# GenAI Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

A full-stack, production-ready framework for building, testing, and deploying sophisticated AI systems where multiple agents collaborate to solve complex problems.

Welcome to a new paradigm of AI application development. This framework moves beyond single-purpose AI tools to a cohesive ecosystem where specialized agents work in concert, orchestrated by a central intelligence and accessible through a rich suite of interfaces. From backend API to a polished web UI, this project provides every component needed to bring advanced agentic workflows to life.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

This framework is built on three key principles:

- 🧩 **Modularity**: Each component—from individual agents to the UI—is decoupled and self-contained. This makes the system easy to extend, test, and maintain. Adding a new AI capability is as simple as creating a new agent.
- 🧪 **Testability**: A system is only as good as its reliability. With a built-in evaluation suite, you can create repeatable tests to validate agent performance and ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
- 🤝 **Usability**: Powerful AI should be accessible. With a REST API, an interactive CLI, and a polished Streamlit UI, the system caters to developers, testers, and end-users alike, making it perfect for both development and demonstration.

## 💻 A Tour of the System: How to Use It

### Testing the Core Components

Test the orchestrator’s routing logic:

```bash
python -m scripts.test_orchestrator
```

Test a specific agent (e.g., Code Explainer):

```bash
python -m scripts.test_code_explainer
```

Run the evaluation suite:

```bash
python -m evaluations.eval_runner
```

---

### Running the Full System

Start the backend API server:

```bash
uvicorn api_server:app --reload
```

API is live at: `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Interacting via the REST API

Call the orchestrator with a structured input:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/instruct   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d "{"input": {"code": "def hello_world():\n  print(\"Hello, World!\")", "language": "Python", "depth": "beginner"}}"
```

Run a workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/workflow_agent   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   --data @test_workflow.json
```

---

### Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Start interactive chat:

```bash
python cli.py chat
```

Call specific agent:

```bash
python cli.py agent sql_generator_agent   "instruction=Get all users from India"   "table_schema=CREATE TABLE users (id INT, name TEXT, country TEXT);"   "sql_dialect=Standard SQL"
```

Run workflow with overrides:

```bash
python cli.py workflow test_workflow.json   "resume=Arshad Jamal, a skilled Cloud Engineer with 5 years experience in AWS and Terraform."   "job_description=We are hiring a DevOps professional with strong AWS and Infrastructure-as-Code skills."
```

Inspect shared memory:

```bash
python cli.py mem
```

---

### Using the Streamlit Web UI

Start the UI:

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```
