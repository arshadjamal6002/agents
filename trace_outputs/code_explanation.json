    "summary": "This code is a simple function in Python that takes in a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.",
    "line_by_line": "- The first line defines a function called \"sum_list\" that takes in one parameter, \"numbers\".\n- The second line creates a variable called \"sum\" and sets it to 0.\n- The third line starts a for loop that iterates through each number in the \"numbers\" list.\n- Inside the for loop, the current number is added to the \"sum\" variable.\n- The for loop ends and the function returns the value of \"sum\".",
    "recommendations": "- It would be helpful to add comments to the code to explain what each line is doing.\n- The function could be made more versatile by allowing it to take in any type of iterable, not just a list.\n- It would be more efficient to use the built-in \"sum\" function instead of creating a new variable and adding to it in a for loop."
